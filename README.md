# SWIG Example

This is an example of how to use CMake with the [SWIG](http://www.swig.org) interface generator. It is meant for those
interested to use as a guide to setting up a project built by CMake with interfaces in other languages generated by
SWIG.

It is a sans-box repository for testing SWIG wrapping on [clEsperanto/CLIc_prototype](https://github.com/clEsperanto/CLIc_prototype) clEsperanto.
